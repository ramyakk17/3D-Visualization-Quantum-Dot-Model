Instructions:

This project is made using QT.The zip folder consists of the project file.
QMake to make the makefile.

IMPORTANT NOTE: makefile created by qmake in my system had following issue  
and bin/rcc.exe had to be replaced by rcc.exe to make it work as per
http://ellacharmed.wordpress.com/2012/11/06/google-really-is-your-friend/

Once makefile is created type command make, go the the release folder and
run QDModel.exe

The project visualizes the probability of electron in the shown quantum dot
model.
The input files are in binary. I have used marching cubes
algorithm to display the probability of the given state. QTSpinbox can be 
used to visualize 6 different states.
Click Play to let the visualization show different states.
Probability can be changed using the scroll bar. Visualization is done
from the max probability value to the selected probability value

Click Transparent to display it transparent,implemented in gradation.
The Cube and Pyramid can be displayed or removed as per user choice.

Slicing option is added to compare the states per slice.

Any visualization can now be saved as a set of images into a pdf file

Click Reset to reset the display to initial view.
